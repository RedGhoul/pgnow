PostgreSQL Monitoring Tool Specification
Purpose
The PostgreSQL Monitoring Tool aims to provide a comprehensive, real-time overview of a PostgreSQL database’s health, performance, and resource usage, centralized in a single, easy-to-use dashboard. It assists database administrators and developers in monitoring critical metrics, identifying issues, and optimizing database performance.
Key Features
1. Database Status
Current Status: Indicates whether the database is up or down.

Uptime: Displays how long the database has been running.

Version Information: Shows the PostgreSQL version in use.

2. Connections
Active Connections: Number of currently active connections.

Idle Connections: Number of idle connections.

Maximum Allowed Connections: Total connection limit set in the database configuration.

Usage Trends: Visual representation of connection usage over time (e.g., a graph).

3. Performance
Queries per Second: Rate of queries executed.

Average Query Time: Mean execution time of queries.

Top Slow Queries: Lists the top 3-5 slowest queries with their execution times and details (e.g., SQL text).

4. Resource Usage
CPU Usage: Percentage of CPU consumed by the database.

Memory Usage: Total and used memory by the database process.

Disk I/O: Read and write operations per second.

Network I/O: Data sent and received over the network (if applicable).

Trends: Graphs showing resource usage over time.

5. Storage
Database Size: Total size of the database.

Table Sizes: Sizes of the top 5 largest tables.

Growth Trends: Rate of database size increase (e.g., over the last 24 hours).

6. Indexes
Index Usage Statistics: Percentage of queries utilizing indexes.

Recommendations: Highlights unused indexes or suggests potential missing indexes based on query patterns.

7. Transactions & Locks
Transactions per Second: Rate of transactions executed.

Commits and Rollbacks: Counts of successful commits and failed rollbacks.

Average Transaction Duration: Mean time taken per transaction.

Locks Held: Number of active locks.

Deadlocks: Number of detected deadlocks with involved queries.

8. Replication (Optional)
Replication Status: Indicates if replication is active (for setups with replication).

Replication Lag: Time delay between primary and replica servers.

Replica Health: Basic status of replica servers (if applicable).

9. Error Logs
Recent Errors: Displays the latest error messages from PostgreSQL logs with timestamps.

10. Customization
Configurable Dashboard: Allows users to select which metrics to display prominently.

Alert Thresholds: Options to set custom thresholds for alerts (e.g., high CPU usage, excessive connections).

Technical Requirements
User Interface
Web-Based Dashboard: A clean, organized interface with sections or tabs for each feature category.

Real-Time Updates: Metrics refresh periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) or in real-time using technologies like WebSockets.

Data Collection
Source: Utilizes PostgreSQL’s built-in statistics views (e.g., pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_database) and system catalogs.

Efficiency: Queries are optimized to minimize load on the database.

Configuration
Database Connection: Supports configuration of connection parameters (host, port, database name, username, password) provided securely outside the tool.

Extensibility
Future-Proof Design: Structured to allow easy addition of new metrics or features.

Performance Considerations
Low Overhead: Ensures the tool itself does not significantly impact database performance by using lightweight queries and configurable refresh intervals.

Optional Integrations
Multiple Databases: Capability to monitor multiple PostgreSQL instances from a single dashboard.

Notifications: Integration with external services (e.g., email, Slack) for alerts.

Deployment
Standalone Application: Can be deployed independently or integrated into a larger monitoring ecosystem.

Containerization: Supports deployment via Docker for ease of setup and scalability.
